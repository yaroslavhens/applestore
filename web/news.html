							<p class="news-text"> <img src="img/home4.jpg"> Yesterday I told the story of Zach, a Macworld reader who
								discovered that his 2018 11-inch iPad Pro was starting to bend down
								the middle after a month of normal use. We reported that Zach was
								on his way to see if Apple would replace the device, particularly in
								light of Apple’s acknowledgement that some 11-inch iPad Pro models
								would be bent from the moment you opened the box, owing to a problem
								with the cooling process during manufacture. This was normal,
								Apple seemed to suggest in an unquoted statement, and as such
								Apple wouldn’t replace units outside the first 14 days.

								I’m happy to report that on Friday, Zach was able
								to get a replacement iPad Pro. I’m not so happy to report,
								though, that he had to pay a $49 service fee in order to get it.

								Importantly, Zach has AppleCare+, so it’s doubtful
								he would have been able to get that replacement without it.
								This is in line with earlier reports on forums and subreddits,
								which claimed that Apple was charging a deductible on the assumption
								that bent iPads were the result of accidental damage. Frankly, I was
								more annoyed by the $49 fee than Zach, who told me in a Twitter message
								that he’s "satisfied" and that it "worked out about as good as I could imagine.
								" Still, much of Zach’s relief springs from his
								initial fears that Apple wouldn’t replace the device at all.</p>

							<p class="news-text"> <img src="img/im.jpg">
								Microsoft rarely mentions Internet
								Explorer (IE) anymore, but when it does,
								it usually means bad news.

								So it was Wednesday, when Microsoft
								issued a rare emergency security update
								to plug a critical vulnerability in the still-supported IE9, IE10 and IE11.
								The flaw was reported to Microsoft by Google security engineer Clement Lecigne.

								The update was issued to Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 - the latter with patches
								for versions 1607 and later - as well as Windows Server 2008, 2012,
								and 2019. (Updates for some versions of Windows 10 - 1607 and 1703 - were
								available
								only to Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education.
								Microsoft demoted IE to legacy status in early 2016; although
								the firm promised to continue patching the browser's
								it stopped improving or enhancing it. The only reason Microsoft still
								serviced IE was so business users of Windows 7, 8.1 and 10 could continue
								to run custom web apps and aged intranet sites. The future, Microsoft
								has said time and time again, is Edge, which runs only on Windows 10.</p>

							<h2 class="news-text-tit"> APPLE RELEASES IOS 12.1.2, ADDRESSING ESIM ACTIVATION BUGS </h2>
							<p class="news-text"> <img src="img/newshome.png">
								Apple released iOS 12.1.1 fewer than two weeks ago, fixing
								a handful of bugs and expanding eSIM support. Today, Apple is fixing a few remaining bugs with iOS 12.1.2, as more carriers around the world roll out eSIM support for the iPhone XS and XR. (T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon now support adding lines via eSIM in the U.S.)

								The release notes for 12.1.2 are the shortest we’ve
								seen in a long time.

								iOS 12.1.2 includes bug fixes for your iPhone
								. This update:
								<br>
								&nbsp; 1.Fixes bugs with eSIM activation for iPhone XR,
								iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max.
								<br>
								&nbsp;2.Addresses an issue that could affect cellular
								connectivity in Turkey for iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and
								XS Max.
								As you can see, this update only fixes a few eSIM activa
								tion bugs and cellular connectivity issues in Turkey.
								It’s possible that, although undocumented, this update may


								also make changes to iPhones in China to comply with the
								terms o
								f the Qualcomm patent lawsuit. Qualcomm recently won an injunctio
								n against selling many iPhones in China, and while Apple said all
								of its phones were already compliant and would remain on sale, it al
								so said it would release a software update that addresses
								"the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case
								."
